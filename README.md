# chance
i'll make this pretty later  
first of all. i am a chance fictive. if you have a problem with systems of any kind/view introjects as 'roleplayers', don't interact. i use he/they unless otherwise specified.  
i prefer you to whisper me if you wanna interact because honestly i'm usually either offtab, in vr, or just afk and will miss the message otherwise. uuuu also i have narcolepsy so if i conk out i won't be able to reply either ww. beware i'm sort of a quiet person and probably won't say much - my energy is *always* low
  
i don't mind ships interacting, but please don't come up to me and talk about past!ichance in detail, especially if i don't know you well. due to the circumstances of my (and my isaac's) canon, i find it weird. he was heavily influenced and, at one point, possessed by the darkheart
also just don't be weird about ichance in general please ty  
i *do* like chickenroulette, toughluck, paycheck, and luckyhacker specifically as platonic pairings  

if you came from/have seen my system's dni, disregard it with me. even though i'm the host,, some of what is listed there isn't applicable to me (e.g. 'itrapped ids')
also i like doubles hi please int  

## dni
◈ basic dni criteria (includes pro/dark-shippers)  
◈ system skeptics & exclusionists  
◈ chance or itrapped yumeshippers  
◈ if you find 'dry texting' annoying (see first paragraph)  
◈ anti-kin  
◈ below 16 y/o bodily. i am 18  
◈ if you're heavily against selfcest/mirror ships  

## iwc
◈ doublefedora shippers  
◈ mafioso ids (non-ids, aka cosplayers/roleplayers int with EXTREME caution. had some bad experiences with rpers being rlly inconsiderate)  
◈ v canon-compliant itrapped ids
